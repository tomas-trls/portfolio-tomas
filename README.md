# 🌟 Portfolio Project 🦦 

This site is a home page for my portfolio, It is the first independent project from _Nology.
It describes my life, my technical skills, my previous project and has links to my Github and Linkedin.

I tried to push the limits of CSS, using all the tools available, such as grid and flexbox. It was really hard to adjust the images in order to have a reponsive site. But I managed to understand how ```max-width``` & ```max-height``` work!
