# 🌟 Portfolio Project 🦦 

This site is a home page for my portfolio, It is the first independent project from _Nology.
It describes my life, my technical skills, my previous projects and has links to my Github and Linkedin.

I tried to push the limits of CSS, using all the tools available, such as grid and flexbox. It was really hard to adjust the images in order to have a reponsive site. But I managed to understand how ```max-width``` & ```max-height``` work! 


## 💥 Setup / Installation Requirements 💥

Open the terminal or a similar CLI on your computer.
- Change the directory to your Desktop.
- copy ```https://github.com/tomas-trls/portfolio-tomas.git```

👾 In your Terminal 👾

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/tomas-trls/portfolio-tomas.git
```
Open the new folder on your Desktop named ```portfolio-tomas```.

Open the ```index.html``` file inside the folder.

## Future Features 🦄
  - I still need to make a proper mobile sandwich menu, but I am waiting to learn JS to do it!. 
  - I will also write real texts, not using only Lorem Ipsum.
  - I hope I can improve my site using React and new Technologies that we will with the other _Nologists!
